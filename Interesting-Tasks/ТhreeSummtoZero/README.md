# Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

# Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

# Example:

Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:

[

  [-1, 0, 1],

  [-1, -1, 2]

]


# Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

# Example:

Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
